Welcome to BarFix!

As a new student, I would have really appreciated someone telling me where to go and what to eat and drink in Sheffield! Enter BarFix, the website made for students, by students, to give some advice and help you plan your great night out!!

This website gives a map of West Street and Division Street, two of our favorite places to eat and drink in Sheffield due to the wonderful options! Utilize our map to hover over the markers and see where each restaurant and bar is located. Then click through the Cocktails + Bar link, the Restaurant link, or the DIY Bar Crawl link for lists of bars and restaurants. These lists can then be clicked, in order to bring you to their webpages. The interactive uses of the pages, along with the lovely pictures, map, and links allow students a fun interactive experience.

We hope that this website will help students to get some idea of fun new places to go with your friends on a night out in Sheffield! Enjoy!
